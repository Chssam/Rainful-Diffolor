Support editing both graphic, raster & vector (Image & SVG).

Networking editor

# Highlight

View path as pixels without the need export to view.

Ctr + C on path copy as image.

# Downside
Each objects require more memory due to ui design

Drawing not smooth compare to others editors.

# Issues

Didn't test ability to connect public network. Only work on local network. (Testing issue)

Minimize windows will crash the application. (UI issue)

Resize tool either working or not, doesn't apply value change, only view illusion.

# Feedback

This project currently under my studies,
~~will either _maintain & rewrite or even abandone_ for coming days,
depends how it goes the rest of the year.~~
Will discontinue after 16/11/2024, lack of motivation to continue.
This can be due aren't my main motivation focus.
But I do enjoy things I discover along the journey making it.

The source code may or may not be useful, the way to manage code base.

16/11/2024 will drop first also last update of the code.
